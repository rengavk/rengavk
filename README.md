## 🚀 About Me 
I am a data and business analyst with a strong drive to use data into make real impact. Over the past few years, I have worked on projects ranging from customer retention and pricing analytics to forecasting and operational dashboards, always with the goal of making insights practical and easy for decision-makers to use.

I enjoy building dashboards that actually guide decisions, designing models that explain customer behavior, and automating reporting so teams can focus on solving bigger challenges. My approach is not just technical — I’m equally motivated by working with stakeholders, asking the right questions, and connecting data to strategy.

Outside of work, I enjoy music, spending time in nature hiking and playing sports and I’m always curious to learn something new. For me, the best part of working with data is that “EUREKA” moment — when I interpret or I (could say) find the fact that is lying under the data.

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On 

- **Smarter Object Detection:** Experimenting with DinoV3 to boost feature extraction in video streams and exploring how it can be integrated into real-world detection models.
- **From Data to Decisions:** Building BI dashboards that don’t just look good, but actually answer the “so what?” — helping teams act on insights instead of drowning in numbers.
- **Research Paper:** Trust and Explainability in AI driven Business Analytics.

## 🌱 Currently Learning 

- Digging deeper into machine learning workflows — from advanced model tuning to explainability.
- Getting hands-on with cloud-based data solutions like BigQuery and Azure to scale analytics beyond spreadsheets.
